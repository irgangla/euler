# Challenge 2

## Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution 

Calculate Fibonacci numbers smaller 4 million as sequence.
For each element of the sequence, check if the number is even (element % 2 == 0).
If even, add the element to the sum of even numbers.
